# courses-UWaterloo-318

This repository is for content generated for the online delivery of Spatial Analysis (GEOG 318) at the University of Waterloo. If you have recommendations for improvements or suggestions for additional content you would like to see put in a similar format then please let me know. Likewise, if you would like to fork the repository and make contributions, I would be happy to review the work and possibly integrate it. While I do not have a huge amount of time to devote to this initiative at the moment, I will be continuously supporting this repository and making continued improvements and additions.
